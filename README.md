# Usage

### Install Packages

Installs all the dependencies and sets up the `node_modules` folder.

---

The page will reload if you make edits.

---

### Build

```sh
npm run build
```

Builds the app for production in the `build` folder.  
The build is optimized for the best performance, with filenames minified and hashed.  
The app is ready to be deployed.

---

### Additional Commands

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

#### `npm eject`

**Note:** This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t revert it.  
This command removes the single build dependency and copies all configuration files (e.g., webpack, Babel, ESLint) directly into your project for full control.  
Use this if you need to customize the configuration extensively.
